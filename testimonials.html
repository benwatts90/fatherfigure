		"I discovered The Father Figure on Instagram and joined in with his initial trial month of workouts.
		He listened very carefully to my specific fitness needs, even working through some injuries with me.
		After the trial month I knew I wanted to continue his classes,
		not just because his workouts are very effective and easy to follow along with,
		but because he was very approachable and conscientious throughout.
		Though I am always in a rush with my 18 month old and my own business and work,
		it is easy to make sure I get to sessions (mostly) on time,
		and I've never been so consistent with my fitness training before.
		I thoroughly recommend Dan's classes as you are not just improving your fitness
		but getting the knowledge and expertise of someone who is very passionate about what they do,
		and motivates you to be passionate too." -Coralie

			"I have loved the sessions I have been doing with Dan, both in a group and one to one.
			At first I wasn't sure that online sessions would work for me but it's actually brilliant.
			Dan is such a fantastic coach and the workouts are challenging.
			Even on days when my little one has been napping
			I've joined in the sessions and had a really good bodyweight workout. 
			I've found that these sessions have really improved my fitness and balance after giving birth.
			I love that Dan's workouts focus on functional movement, which really helps for chasing a little one.
			I would definitely recommend Dan's workouts for anyone looking to improve their fitness after pregnancy.
			I think my little girl has loved the workouts too!" -Rebecca

		"The PTs were so convenient,
		I could do whatever I need right up until the time it started
		no leaving the house and to have Luke with me was even better! I couldn’t fault it
		you even explained everything so well.
		The classes are well done, I honestly love how involved Magnus is!
		It really shows I can workout with my baby too!"

			"I came across Dan through his Instagram page, I’m so glad I did!
			I’d had a c-section and was 4months postnatal and didn’t have a clue
			what exercises where safe for me to do. I worked a very physical job
			before and I was worried how I’d cope with it went I went back!
			Thankfully with Dan’s support and guidance that’s no longer a worry.
			The clear guidance and support I’ve received alongside our training sessions
			has not only boosted my fitness levels, but also my confidence in myself! 
			And with Dan being a new parent himself, he made every session super manageable
			to do with my little girl and it was lovely not to feel the need to apologise
			all the time if I had to stop to sort her out!"-Samantha MacDonald
